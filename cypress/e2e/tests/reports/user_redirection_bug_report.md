## Bug Report: Absence of User Redirection After Form Submission

**Description**:
After submitting the user creation form, there is no redirection to the user's page. This issue occurs in both Chrome and Firefox browsers. Upon submission, users are not being automatically directed to the newly created user's page as expected.

**Steps to Reproduce**:
1. Access the user creation form.
2. Fill out the required user information.
3. Submit the form.

**Expected Behavior**:
Upon successful submission of the user creation form, the user should be automatically redirected to the newly created user's page.

**Actual Behavior**:
After submitting the user creation form, users remain on the same page or are redirected to a different location not related to the newly created user.

**Additional Information**:
- The problem is consistently reproducible in both Chrome (version XX) and Firefox (version XX) browsers.
- This issue impacts the user experience as users are not provided immediate access to the information they just submitted.

**Priority**: High

**Impact**:
This issue significantly affects user experience and workflow. The lack of redirection might confuse users and prevent them from efficiently accessing and managing the newly created user's details.
