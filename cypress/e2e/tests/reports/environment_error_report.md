## Install Environment Error Report

1. **Error in Container `app_1`**:
   - It appears that uWSGI is being launched within the `app_1` container.
   - The error indicates that during uWSGI startup, it failed to locate and open the `run.py` file.
   - Additionally, it suggests that the application with the mountpoint '' couldn't be loaded, potentially due to a missing callable or import error.
   - uWSGI transitions into full dynamic mode since the application wasn't loaded.

2. **Error in Container `migration_1`**:
   - A similar error occurred in the `migration_1` container while attempting to open the `run.py` file.
   - Error: `python: can't open file 'run.py': [Errno 13] Permission denied`.
   - This error indicates that the `run.py` file cannot be opened due to a lack of read permissions.

3. **uWSGI Warning**:
   - Within the `app_1` container, there's a warning indicating that uWSGI is running without its master process manager.
   - It is advisable to use process managers to ensure more stable operation and effective control over uWSGI processes.

### Recommended Solutions:
- Ensure that the `run.py` file exists in the directory specified for the container and possesses appropriate read permissions.
- For the `app_1` container, verify that you've accurately provided the path to the `run.py` file and that it genuinely represents your WSGI application.
- Consider using system process managers to ensure reliable management of uWSGI startup and shutdown.
- When adjusting permissions and file access rights, exercise caution and prioritize security.

These errors are associated with file loading, access, and proper uWSGI configuration. It's also pivotal to ensure that your files and settings are suitably aligned between containers and processes.
