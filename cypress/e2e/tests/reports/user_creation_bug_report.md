## Bug Report: Form Data Submission Does Not Create User, Returns createuser: null, status code: 200

**Description**:
Upon submitting the user creation form, the expected user creation process does not occur. Instead, the response "createuser: null" is received, along with a status code of 200. This issue arises due to the absence of the necessary "Users" table with required fields in the database.

**Steps to Reproduce**:
1. Access the user creation form.
2. Fill out the required user information.
3. Submit the form.

**Expected Behavior**:
After submitting the user creation form, a new user should be successfully created in the database. The response should include relevant data confirming the user's creation.

**Actual Behavior**:
Upon form submission, the response received is "createuser: null" and the status code is 200, indicating success. However, no new user is created, likely due to the absence of the necessary "Users" table in the database.

**Additional Information**:
- The issue is consistent across different browsers.
- This issue severely impacts the functionality of user creation and database integration.

**Priority**: Critical

**Impact**:
The inability to create users through the form submission process hinders core system functionality. The missing "Users" table prevents the storage of user data, potentially rendering the system unusable.
